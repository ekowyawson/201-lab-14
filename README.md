# 201 Lab 14: Data Storage, Retrieval, and Charting

## Problem Domain

> The design team has decided to extract the chart from the voting page and move it to a separate results page on the website. We will need to create a new page for the chart, link to it, and then have that page generate the chart, using the voting data from the main page. At any time, a user should be able to revisit the chart page and see the last set of voting results.

## Instructions

If partnered with another student:

1. Add the other person as a collaborator. That means that both of you will have privileges to push and merge to that repo.
2. Plan and develop the necessary code in the JavaScript and CSS files, but **do not modify the HTML files in any way**.
3. The `index.html` is where the users will be voting on the items.
4. The `chart.html` page will display the voting results using **Chart.js**.
5. The `css/styles.css` file, which is currently empty, will house your design and styles for this application.

## Tips

Here are some things to think about as you go plan out the lab for today:

* Youâ€™ll need to use local storage to share data between the two HTML pages.
* Complete the //TODO items in the order that works best for you.
* Make small changes, and test them as you go.
* Complete all TODO items in the JavaScript files.
* Give the app some style.
* Deploy the app.
* Do **NOT** modify the html files.
